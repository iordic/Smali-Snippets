# Smali Snippets
This repository contains basic examples of Smali code. For learning purposes.<br>
Generated *.line* and other stuff have been removed from source code.<br><br>
In the **[wiki](https://github.com/iordic/Smali-Snippets/wiki)** this snippets will
be added and explained. Also I will add Java equivalent code.

### How code is generated
Followed steps to obtain Smali source code have been:
1. Generate a project and write the code with [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/).
2. Build an APK with it.
3. Use of [APK Studio](https://github.com/vaibhavpandeyvpz/apkstudio) to decompile and obtain generated smali code.

Feel free to send pull requests with more examples or adding corrections.
